# Taking input in Python
In Python, you can take input from the user using the input() function. This function reads a line from the input (usually from the keyboard) and returns it as a string.
# Taking input from console
In Python, taking input from the console is typically done using the input() function. The input() function reads a line from the console, and by default, it returns the input as a string. You can prompt the user with a message and then use the input in your program.
* Taking name as input
* Console Input with Data Conversion
* handling Multiple Inputs at Once
# Taking multiple inputs from user in Python
* Multiple Inputs in One Line (Using split())
* Multiple Inputs in One Line (Using map())
* Multiple Inputs on Separate Lines
* Multiple Inputs on Separate Lines
* Taking Multiple Inputs and Storing Them in a List
* Taking Multiple Inputs with a Loop 
# Python | Output using print() function
In Python, the print() function is used to output data to the console. It can print strings, numbers, variables, and other data types.
* The first line prints a simple string.
* The second line prints a number.
* The third line demonstrates printing multiple items with a single print() call.
* The fourth line shows how to print the values of variables.
* The fifth line uses an f-string to format the output neatly.
# How to print without newline in Python?
In Python, the print() function automatically adds a newline character at the end of its output. To print without a newline, you can use the end parameter of the print() function and set it to an empty string or any other string you want to use as a separator.
# Python end parameter in print()
The end parameter in Python's print() function allows you to specify what should be printed at the end of the output. By default, the print() function ends with a newline ('\n'), which means each print() statement outputs on a new line
# Python | sep parameter in print()
The sep parameter in Python's print() function allows you to define a custom separator between multiple items when they are printed. By default, print() separates items with a space (' '), but you can change this to any string of your choice.
# Python | Output Formatting
* Using f-strings (formatted string literals)
* Using str.format() Method
* Using % Operator (Old-style formatting)
* Using format() for Padding and Alignment
* Using the pprint Module for Pretty Printing
f-strings: Modern and easy-to-read formatting.

str.format(): Flexible and versatile for various formatting needs.

% operator: Traditional formatting method.

Padding and alignment: Useful for creating neatly formatted tables or columns.

pprint module: Ideal for pretty-printing complex data structures.
